# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://eacgxwbshaeyrtxsbkat.supabase.co
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script from `database/schema.sql` to create all tables and sample data

## Disable Email Verification (Optional)
To disable email verification and allow users to login immediately after signup:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings** 
3. Find **User Signups** section
4. Turn OFF **"Enable email confirmations"**
5. Save the changes

This will allow users to be automatically logged in after signup without needing to verify their email.

## Database Configuration
The application uses the following tables:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `products` - Department wears catalog
- `orders` - Customer orders and status tracking

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```

```

- Users can view all products

- Admin-specific operations are handled separately

## Admin Access
- Admin login: `admin@dynasty.com` / `password1234` (hardcoded)
